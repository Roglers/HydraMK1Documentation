For the Motion Systema nd Toolchanger you will need to print the following parts. It is recommended to print several parts in PETG as they will either be exposed to raised temperatures or mechancial stress. The other parts can also be printed in PETG or a material that is easier to print such as PLA. Optimal orientation and support structures can be found in the TC.3mf file. If you are using a different cable brace, please adapt the "TC Top Block" and "" parts.
