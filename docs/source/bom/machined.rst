Machined Parts
################################

The Hydra MK1 assembly requires two differt machined parts. One has to be lathed, the other can be milled or cut by waterjet.

TC Belt Plate
=============

Please find the technical drawing and step file in the machined parts folder. You will need two identical parts, milled or cut from 2mm aluminiumplates with general tolerances. If your supplier offers taping as a service, you can add M3 taps to the outer four holes that have a 2.5mm diameter. Otherwise you will have to tap these holes yourself. Make sure the the two 3.2mm holes second from the top are countersunk, so an M3 screw sits flush with the top as shown in the figure below.

TC Shaft
============

Please find the technical drawing and step file in the machined parts folder. You will need a shaft machined out of sttel with general tolerances.

V4 Pellet Extruder
===================

If you are planning on using a V4 Pellet Extruder in your machine, you will need to machine an additional part for each pellet extruder you are panning to use. You can find the "V4_Pellet_Clamp" technical drawing and step file in the machined parts folder.
